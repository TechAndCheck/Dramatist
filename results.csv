Nicholas fat and he's from Jenkintown Pennsylvania that's close to here here in Philadelphia,inform how dangerous this virus was and all the way back in the beginning of February I argued that we should be keeping people in China and we had set up an art ministration a pandemic office within the White House there are 44 people on the ground I suggest we should be seeking and I didn't hold public office I was a former vice president I suggest we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem and the best of our knowledge Trump never pushed that,he didn't say a word anybody then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this using the there's an act as passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say stop making this and start making that and took a long time for him to even Institute that get ventilators and so on and so the point was he missed an enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren't true it's going to go away by Easter don't worry about it's going to oo,now to detail plan relative to school openings in June and July and talked about begat by that time the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly that the president kept denying that if you notice from March on I stopped doing big meetings I started wearing masks we you know so it was at a time when the science was saying and his key people dr.
