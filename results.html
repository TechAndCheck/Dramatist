</span><span style="background-color:#44dc4d">Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff and welcome to the PBS NewsHour special coverage of the first 2020 presidential debate in just a few moments President Donald Trump and former Vice President. Joe. Biden will be in the spotlight in Cleveland, Ohio in their first one-on-one debate. It's the first of three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate ahead of Election Day November 3rd due to the pandemic only about 80 people will be in the audience in person tonight on the campus of Case Western Reserve University, which is co-hosting the event with the Cleveland Clinic. The moderator is Fox News Chris Wallace. We at the NewsHour are practicing social distancing while I am broadcasting from our studio our reporters and our analysts. Will join us remotely that's White House correspondent you Michel sender our Congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins, who's covering the Biden campaign senior National correspondent. Amin avaaz will be watching the debate with a half a dozen voters from around the country Amy Walter of the cook political report along with Washington Post contributing columnist Gary Abernathy joining us from Ohio and syndicated columnist Cynthia Tucker in Alabama. We welcome to all of you and we're going to ask you. All for a quick word from each one of you starting with you Miche tell us how is the president preparing? The president did not do tradition traditional debate prep. He wasn't having mock debates or having anybody play his political opponent, but what he was doing was testing out his attacks on Joe Biden in the media and answering questions from reporters. So what we can expect the president to really go after Jill Biden in very personal terms, he's going to go after Hunter Biden he's going to go after Joe Biden's history and his record on China on the criminal justice system on so many other fronts. I mean the president is really someone who's going to make this in some ways a brawl. He's looking Fourth street fight. So there are people in the Trump campaign who feel that he is confident and that he will do a good job here. So meanwhile Lisa Desjardins, how is Joe Biden preparing? The Biden Camp has had a more traditional preparation in some ways you do you could say Joe Biden has prepared for this moment since 1987 the first time he ran for president tonight. They say he will defend his record. But also go after President Trump when needed the question will be when does he engage with President Trump? And when does he step back and let viewers decide the president's words for themselves to Amy Walter Amy. What is the one thing you're looking for tonight? Well, it's unlikely that we're going to see overnight. Opinions about either of these candidates are going to change. What I'm really looking for is to see if the narrative changes in the next few days after this debate is Donald Trump able to get off his back foot onto his front foot make it about something other than his own challenges make it about the shortcomings of Joe Biden and of Oz you are going to be watching with a group of Voters from around the country have they made their minds up yet? Judy most of them have assembled a group of six people from around the country from Tennessee, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, South Carolina and California three providing three for Trump. Only one said he was open to changing his mind. We will be coming back to you after the debate right now as you see debate moderator Chris Wallace about to introduce the candidates. Let's go to Cleveland now as this debate gets </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">underway good evening from the health education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J Trump and former Vice President. Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. The commission has designed the format six roughly 15 minute segments with two-minute answers from each candidate to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed. To these rules for the record. I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you. None of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security advisor to the commission for all four debates as a precaution. Both campaigns have agreed that candidates Will Not Shake Hands at the Of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no booze or other interruptions. So we and more importantly you can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now as we welcome the Republican nominee President Trump and the Democratic nominee Vice President </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Biden. Gentlemen, </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">a lot of people been waiting for this night. So let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court President Trump. You nominated Amy coneybear over the weekend to succeed the light Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court you say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the court Vice President Biden use say that this is an effort. By the president and Republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power my first question to both of you tonight. Why are you write and make the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court President Trump in this first segment you go first two </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">minutes. Thank you very much Chris. I will tell you very simply we won the election elections have consequences. We have the Senate. We have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all top top academic good in every way good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election as you know, so I think that she will be outstanding she's going Be as good as anybody that has served on that Court. We really feel that we have a professor at Notre Dame highly respected by all said she's the single greatest student. He's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we just we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise and by the way, the Democrats they wouldn't even think about not doing it if they had the only differences that try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. If they had married Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped and probably that would happen in Reverse. Also, definitely would happen reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it Chris </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">President Trump. Thank you. Same question to you Vice President Biden. You have two minutes. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">looking forward to this. Mr. President. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">I The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that's a occurs when they vote for a United States senators and when they vote for the president United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already election is already started tens of thousands of people have already voted. And so the thing is should happen is we should wait we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is the president has made it clear. He wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running. On that he ran on that and he had been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having Insurance health insurance. Now if if they if it goes into court and and the justice and I have nothing I'm not opposed to the justice as if she seems like a very fine person but she's written before she went in the bench, which is her right that she thinks that Affordable Care. Character is not constitutional. The other thing is on the court and if it was struck down what happens women's rights are fundamentally changed once again, a woman could be helped a more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. We were able to they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure room and it gets and that ended when we in fact passed the Affordable Care Act and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election if he wins the election and the Senate is Democrat a republican then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">February. All right, there aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as the say is concerned the people already had their say they Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully very strongly at some point ten years ago or so. She said a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time but a president selected for four years were not elected for three is I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate we have a president elected to the next during that period of time during that period of time we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years and I could be Aryan people. Jill the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care that they're very simply not true. Well, you said we're going to socialist and only just social </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">we're now going to gentlemen were now in to open this gospel discussion discussion. Yes, I agree. Go ahead Vice pres number one. He knows that what I proposed. What I propose is that we expand Obamacare. And we increase it. We do not wipe any </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">and one of the big debates we had with 23 </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won we're saying that Biden wanted a loud people to have private insurance Still They can they do they will under my </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">proposal that would you said but and it's not what I've already is sad is simply a party doesn't say you party wants to go socialist medicine already is and socialist. Well now I am and they're going to dominate you Joe, you know that I am the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Democratic party right now. A platform of the data according to Harry is what I in fact approved of what I approved of now here's the deal the deal is that it's going to wipe </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">out pre-existing condition. By the way, the 22 hundred million the 200,000 </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">people that have died on his watch they how many of </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">those and so they have survived. Well, there's 7 million </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">people have contracted covid. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">until you've had the 308,000? Military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper Health Care in the military. So don't tell me about happy to talk about and if you were here you can with me 200 it would be 2 million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't have a demand China which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">All right, we're gentlemen, right it was </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">heavily president. You would have been much later just a problem later. Mr. Pres talking about 2 million people. You're not </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">good enough moderator. We are going to talk about covid in the next segment. But boy ahead let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v-- Wade that's on the ballot as well and the court in the court. And so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all right now, </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">it's on the ballot. Why is it in the ballot? Because because you're just answering the ballot it's on the ballot in the courting 7 the court. Well, it's nothing happening there Donald would you just don't know her? View on Roe v-- Wade, I don't review. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Well, alright, that's it. Alright, let's talk. I would we got a lot to unpack here - I don't know. We got a lot of time. So on Healthcare and well, then we'll come back to Roe v-- Wade. All right. Mr. President that the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration along with 18 State Attorneys General are seeking to overturn. That's right Obamacare to end Obamacare you have spent the last </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">because that one If I would help </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">okay, if I may I ask a question sir. Good health care over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare. But you have never in these 4 years come up with a plan a comprehensive plans to replace Obamacare versa have well, I'll get it out of the individual mandate to give you an answer. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of apprehensive. That </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare Chris that </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">waiting here is part of </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">it was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">it. I'd like to we will press and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer your Hedren you in the course of these four years have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect. With pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question sir is what is the Trump healthcare </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">plan? Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something that there's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no president has a courage to do because you're going against big Pharma drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90% You could have done it during your forty seven year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting health care about all of the things that we've done in Sorrento. I give you an example insulin. It's going to it was destroying families destroying people the cause I'm getting it for so cheap. It's like water you want to know the truth. So cheap take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing prescription drug prices. We're going to allow our Governor's now to go to other countries to buy drugs because one and they pay just a tiny </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">fraction of this is open discussion will be yes it is. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the vice president, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare the argument that he makes another Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance It is Well, if I start asking the question it will allow your party says by the way, it will and private insurance and create a government takeover of Health Care. It does not it's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Medicaid. And they can get </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">that free in Most states except Governors who want to deny people are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare would be Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option the vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option number one. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">So you agree chip with Bernie Sanders are left on the manifesto. We knew it would manifest you socialized medicine. Look. Hey, are you saying can listen to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">them the fact of the matter? Is I beat Bernie Sanders not by much. I beat him a whole hell of a lot. I'm not sure I'm here standing facing </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">you or hottest would have left two days early. You would have lost every Pride he knows how to do it is day. You got very large the deal. I got very lucky aiming it very lucky </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">tonight as well. And tonight. I'm going to washer because here's the deal. Here's the deal the fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out as lies. Everybody knows he's a </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">liar, but you I just want to manage it. Make sure your did last in your class at first. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">I want to make sure I didn't can you let him finish sir? He doesn't know how to do that. He has </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">you know, you pick be surprised but long guy the wrong night at the wrong time said you agreed with here's a descender Sentimental idea. There is </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">no Manifesto numbers. Let him speak. Mr. Number two. Just lost the left. Number two. You </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">just lost the left you agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan both ships. Do you have any idea what this thing is doing? Let's try to do you have to do socialized medicine? </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Mr. President you what he is not for any help for people needing health care because his because he in fact already has cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two. There are 20 million people getting Health Care through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't don't ever look in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">away. I want to give number 3 Health Care at a much lower price because I like he doesn't know how he doesn't know how to do that fixed. He has never offered a plan to what extent he has never account a single. I know but probably doesn't realize if </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">you're both speaking at the same time. It's to expect let the president's go ahead </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">sir. Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on we took away the individual mandate we guarantee pre-existing conditions, but Took away the individual mandate. Listen. This is the way it is and that destroyed that they shouldn't even call it Obamacare that I had a choice to make do I let my people run it really well or badly if I run it badly, they'll probably blame him but they'll blame me but more importantly I want to help people. Okay. I said you got to run it. So well, that's what and I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is no matter how well you run Obamacare. It's a disaster. It's too expensive premium. Z2i that it doesn't work. So P. We do want to get rid of it. I want to get rid of </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">it. But I have to have to give you roughly equal time. Please let the vice president </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">would he has </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">no plan for health care because we did cents please he sends out wishful thinking he has executive orders have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising to health care plan since he got elected. He has none like almost everything else. He talks about he does. I have a plan. He doesn't have a plan and the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. He's had once I have one final question for you. Mr. Vice president. If Senate Republicans, we were talking original about the Supreme Court here if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm just as Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court adding to the nine justices there you call this a distraction by the president, but in fact It wasn't brought up by the president. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in I'm saying the Congress. So my question to you is you have refused in the past to talk about it. Are you willing to tell the American people tonight? Whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the quiver position I take in that that will become the </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">vote you're in voting now vote </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">and let your Senators know. How strong are you feeling? Let's vote. Now to pack to make sure you in fact let people know is where Senators I'm not going to answer the question because it said that because the question is the question is just as the radish to left. Will you shut up man who is on your list Joe? This is ano </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">right gentlemen, I think this is so we have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment. It was really a productive segment wondering </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Keep yapping man. The people understand you. She takes forty seven years. You've done nothing. They understand. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">All right, the second subject is covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus and the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine experts say that it could be months or even years. For we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021. Why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this Public Health crisis going forward in this case. The question goes to you first, sir, two minutes uninterrupted. Good luck 200,000 dead. Did you said over 7 million infected the United States? We in fact have five percent or 4 percent of the world's population twenty percent of the deaths 40,000 people did a day are Contracting covid in addition to that about between 750 and a </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">thousand people they are dying when he was presented with that number. He said it is what it is. Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">why it is </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">the president has </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">What did he do? He's on tape is acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic he panicked in addition to that. What did he do? He went in and he we were insisting that the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">The people we </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">determine for themselves how dangerous this was. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">He did not even ask she to do that. He told us what a great job. She was doing he said we owe him a debt of </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">gratitude for being so </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">transparent with us. And what did he do? Then? He then did nothing he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out back in March exactly what we should be doing and I laid out again. In July what we should be doing we should be </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">providing all the protective gear pause. We should be providing the money. The </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">house has passed in order to be able to go out and get </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">people the help. They need to keep their businesses open open schools that cost a lot of money </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">you should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and get in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats Republicans and fun what needs to be done now to save lives. So if we would have listened to you have two minutes, sir. If we would have listened to you, the country would have been left wide open millions of people would have died not two hundred thousand and one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in but it was China's fault. And by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done I closed it. And you said he's in a phobic. He's a racist and he's in a phobic. Because you didn't think that they had to close our </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">country not just wait a minute has two </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">minutes. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months by my doing it early. In fact, dr. Fouch. He said President Trump saved thousands of Lives Many of you had Democrat Governor said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governor really go take a look. The governor said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that in fact people that would Not be necessarily on my side said that President Trump did a phenomenal job. We did we got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators you wouldn't have made ventilators and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing Therapeutics already fewer people are dying when they get sick far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news no matter what you say to them. They give you bad press on it's just fake news. They give you good press they give Give me bad press because that's the way it is. Unfortunately, but let me just tell you something. I don't care I've gotten used to it, but I'll tell you Joe. You could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that yet. I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job. Well, you didn't do very well in swine flu H1N1 you were a disaster your own cheek warts and sales </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">disaster. 14,000 people died. Not 200,000. There was a very anomalous Escher you made up there. There's no one there's no we didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy as being he shut down. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">The reason it's shut down is because look you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at covid how </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">many of you were in a situation where you lost your mom or dad </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">and you couldn't even speak to them. You had a nurse holding a phone up so you can in fact say goodbye </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">little us far when he put far more people and you would have been by the way Slayer on his own. His own CDC director says we could lose as many as another </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">200,000 people between now and the end of the year and he held up. He said if we just wear a mask we can save </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">half those numbers just just a mask. And by the way in </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">terms of the whole notion of a </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">vaccine we're for a vaccine but we I don't trust him at all. Nor do you I know you don't but we trust as a scientist, you know, because such as Howard Johnson finds it </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">we got by the way and let me move on to questions about the future. As you both have touched on one of the two of the questions. I'm going to ask focusing on the future for a President Trump. You have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments on top scientists the week before last the head of the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words Hut dr. Slough a the head of your operation. Wharf speed has said exactly the same thing. Are they both </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">wrong? Well, I've spoken to the companies that we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. It is a very political thing. I've spoken to fisa. I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to we have great moderna Johnson & Johnson and others they can go faster than that by a lot become very political because the left or I don't know if I go to your left. You know what? </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">I can head up your operation warp speed doctors. I </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">disagree with him. No, I disagree with both him and he didn't say that. He said it could be there but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">days. He talked about the summer sir before it's generally available to </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">initially said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">be able to the generally available now, well, </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically. They're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do A thousand a day they're going to be this is the same man. It's all set up </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">by Easter. This would be gone away by the warm weather it be gone baracus like a miracle. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">And by the way, maybe could </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">inject some bleach in your arm. And that would take care of it. This is a </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">sort of said sarcastic. I was you know that I was said so I </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">can so here's the deal this man is talking about a vaccine every serious every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year. But the distribution of That vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. If we get the vaccine and pray God we will make God we will survive for as I want to pick up the 11th attack scene soon want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientist, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight? You're running mate, Senator Harris goes further saying the public health experts quote will be muzzled will be suppressed given the fact that polls already. A show that people are concerned about the vaccine and a reluctant to take it. Are you and your running mate, Senator Harris contributing to that fear no more than the question. You just asked him you pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists, but jurors. Thank you for your son or hours of Sun. You can't trust the sun. Well, no. No, you can't trust the scientist. He does. She didn't say that you can't drink she said the public health experts quote will be muzzled will be </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">surprised. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but There's millions of science. There's thousands of scientists out there like here at this great </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">hospital that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">on him. That's not there the people there and by the way to the scientists that are in charge the way they will have the vaccine very says </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">it but you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies, he's </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">told you about the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">whole issue relating to covid he'd </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">still hasn't even acknowledged that </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">he knew this. Is </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">happening knew how dangerous are going to be back in February and he didn't even tell you he's on record as saying it he panicked or he just looked at the stock market one of the two because guess what a lot of people died and a lot more going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot. So who's the president did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware state but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State you graduated either the Was to are almost the lowest in your class don't ever use the word smart with me don't ever use that word. Oh, give me a because you know, what? There's nothing smart about you Jo 47 years you've done no said this the better of you would have had let me just tell you something Joe now if you would have had the charge of what I was put through I had to close the greatest economy and the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built against </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">going into the economy in the next segment, sir. Okay, it's going up fast. Okay forward when it comes to how the virus has been. Handled so far the two of you have taken very different approaches. And this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those re-openings Vice President Biden. You have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools wiser because he didn't have a plan if I were running and I know how what the plan is, you've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Money to be able to reopen with the PPE as well as with the sanitation. They need you have to provide amnesty policy. Well, </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">he's just shush for a minute. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Tell it to you as you know see and Shimmer by the way, Chuck </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Nancy Pelosi and Schumer. They have a plan. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">He won't even meet with them. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">The Republicans won't meet with the Senate but he </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">sits he sits in his golf course and well, I mean literally think about it. You probably play more than I do Jim. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">What about those question of re-openings and the fact </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">that he He wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open and we did a great job. So Unity. Shut it down. Wait a minute. Let me shut you down for a second Joe just for one second. We want to he wants to shut down the country. We just went through it we had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very very vulnerable. We learned a lot young children aren't even younger people aren't we've learned a lot. He wants to shut it down more people will be heard by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down. They have Democrat Governors. All one of the reasons is shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election in November </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">the effectiveness of now. Masks as a disease preventer. And in fact recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their mass and touching plates. Are you questioning though? I think they'll </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">understand if you look I mean, I have a mess great here. I'll put a mask on it. You know, when I think I need it tonight as an example. Everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to but I wear masks when needed when needed I wear a mask. Okay. Let me ask I don't have to I don't wear masks like him every time you see him he's Masky could be speaking 200 feet away from and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen I will say Vice President Biden. Go ahead sir. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Look the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money the kind I was asking us are about masks well mask mask make a big difference his own </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">now if they're everybody wore masks and social distance between now and January, </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">we'd probably save up to a hundred thousand lives. It matters and they've also said opposite they've also said oh </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">no serious person said the opposite that </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">knows. Well, the series </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">is even affected the way that you have campaign President Trump, you're holding the large rallies with crowds packed together thousands of peanuts. Outside. Yes, sir. A grade Vice President Biden. You are holding much smaller events with nobody will show up people with </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">what's nobody shows up to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">his right? All right, in any case why you holding the big rallies? Why you not you goes for a sir? </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean, </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">but now I'm worried a job. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">This is resident and I have twenty-five thirty five thousand people show up at airports. We use airports. You're not worried about we have a lot of people well, so So far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside. That's a big difference according to the experts and we do them outside. We have tremendous crowds as you see I mean every and literally on 24 hours notice and Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. Okay, by the way, did you see </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">one of the last big rallies he has and a reporter came up to him to ask him a question. He said no, no, no stand back put on your mask put on the mask. Have you been tested? I'm </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">You're </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">way far away from those other people. That's what he said. I can't I'm going to be okay. He know </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there breathing in want to leave had no negative dajjal. No negative effect. We've had no negative effect. And we've had 35 40 thousand people wanted Israelis </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">just like finish up because I want to move on to our next. Yes. I would he's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks basically, encourage them not to alright, then he's a fool on </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">if you could Get the crowds you would have done the same thing, but you can't nobody can tell man. Can we move on to the occurs </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">settlement? Can we move on to the economy? Yes, the economy is I think it's fair to say recovering faster than expected from the shutdown - in the second quarter the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit two growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected president from you. Say we are in a v-shaped recovery. Great Vice President Biden. You say it's more of a k shape what difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy President Trump in this segment you go </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">first. So we built the greatest economy in history. We close it down because of the China plague when the plague came in we close it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong and again two million people would be dead now instead of still. Thousand people is too much one person is too much should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business. We had ten point four million people in a four-month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before and he wants to close down the he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression when you start shutting it down you take a look at what's happening at some of you The Kratt run states where they have these tough shutdowns and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week. You saw that. Oh, we're going to open up a November 9th why November 9th because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them close. They're hurting people people know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash the hands they can wear masks they can do whatever they want. But they got to open these states up when you look at North Carolina when you look at these Governors are Under Siege, Pennsylvania Michigan and a couple of others you get open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost like being in prison and you look at what's going on with divorce. Look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very very sad thing and he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly. Well setting records as it does it we don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">All right your two minutes sir. We're now moved to Do as I said posing the question the President says it's at these shape or cover. You say it's a cage shaped recovery. What's the difference difference is Millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the Cova crisis had done very, well another billionaires of Ray have made another 300 billion dollars because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market, but you folks at home you folks living in Anton </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">and Clement and all the small towns and working-class towns in America. How old are you doing? This guy paid? Well total of 750 dollars in taxes anymore. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Sorry. I understand you've agreed to the two minutes. So please let him have it. I get my time back. The fact is that he is in </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president and states to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration. Then when he became president fewer jobs than when he became friends. One American history. Secondly the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines? </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Those people who have been saving Our Lives those people who have went out there dying people who when putting themselves in the way </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">to make sure that we could all try to make it and the idea that he is insisting that we in go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">in covid s and covid cases in the United States of America. And he </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the America? You can't fix the economy </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">until you fix the covid crisis </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">in terms of your health and your </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">safety schools. Why aren't schools open because it costs a lot of money to open safely. You know, they were going to give his administration going to give the teachers and school students mask then they decided no couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency. See not a National Emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They're closing one in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open say </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">right your time is up Sir. Well, you're going to get to </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">to respond to that. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Well, you both had two minutes, sir. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Excuse me, he made a statement. So did you people want their schools know people want their schools open? They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I at New York, it's so sad. What's happening in New York? It's almost like a ghost town and I'm not sure I can ever recover what they've done in New York people want their places open. They want to get back to their life people. They'll be careful, but they want their school's. Okay. I'm the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I'm very happy to do it. And all right. That's a little high o are very proud of me and you don't have to get back to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but Mr. President as you well know there's a new report that in 2016 the year you were elected president and 2017 your first year as president that you paid 750 dollars a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you the specific question. Is it true that you paid 750 dollars in federal income taxes each of those two </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">years. I paid Millions. Of dollars in taxes millions of dollars of income tax and let me just tell you there was a story in one of the papers that protected paid thirty eight million dollars one year. I paid twenty seven measure sure tax returns. I went you'll see it as soon as it's finished. You'll see it, you know you want to do go to the Board of Elections. There's a hundred and eighteen pager. So report that says everything I have every bank I have I'm totally under leverage because the assets are extremely good and we Very we have a I built our I'm asking </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">you a specific question, which is let me tell you that I understand all of those, you know, mr. President. I'm asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">2017 millions of </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">dollars. You paid millions of dollars of dollars, not 700 years of </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">dollars and you'll get to see it and you'll get tested but let me go along you Chris. Let me just say something that it was the tax laws. I don't want to pay tax because before I came here, I was a private developer. I was a private business people like every other private person unless they're stupid they go through the laws and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for a tax credits, we build the building and we get tax credits like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, you get a passive which by the way was given to me by the Obama Administration if you can believe that now the man got fire Didn't know right after that happened, but </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">it's President Biden you want to respond? Yeah, I do want to respond look the tax code that made him put him in a position that he pays less tax in a school teacher make them on the money a school teacher makes is because of him take he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code and he does take advantage that tax code. That's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts and we're going to we're going to eliminate those texts and make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need to </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">help people out there need help. But why do you do it over to one of the last 25 years, but because you are present do it. Okay, as you are President screwing things up, you were a senator ever the worst president in </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">America has ever had. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Let me just say Joe. I've done more in in 47 months. I've done more than you've done in 47 years Joe we've done things that you never even thought about including mixing the broken military that you gave me. I'm not good at </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">taking care of profit. Mr. Price. We're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward because mr. Vice president your economic plan. If you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government big taxes big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes you propose more than four trillion dollars over a decade and new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy is it's just coming out of a recession. Well, just take a look at what is the the analysis been done by Wall Street firms points out that might my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs in his in four years. Number one and number two, it would create an additional one trillion dollars in economic growth because it would be about buying American that we have to we're going to make this federal government spent six hundred billion dollars a year on I </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">think from ships to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">steal two buildings and the like and under my proposal. We're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a competent respectfully sir. I'm talking about taxes not spend it. Well, by the way, I'm going to eliminate significant number the text. I'm going to make the the corporate tax 28% It shouldn't be 21% You have 19 company 91 companies Federal. I mean and the Fortune 500 who don't </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">pay a single penny in taxes making Billions of dollars in you do it billions of time advice because Obama because you and fact past that that was your attacks proposed got it done. And you know what happened? You got it down economy. Boom. It's never believe </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">economy as well as president. Mr. President. Let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach lower taxes more deregulation. Correct? Not lower taxes American people. Let me get his butt in but in Obama's you talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's. Three years as president more jobs were created a million and a half more jobs that in the first three years of your presidency. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">They had the slowest recovery since 90. Kannamma Creek of every since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something there was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot but that the slowest economic recovery since 1929. Let me tell you about the stock market when the stock market goes up. That means jobs it also Also means 401ks. If you got in if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my texts my taxes. I'll tell you what you'll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave and plenty of companies that are already here. They'll lead to other places have they will leave and you will have a depression the likes of which you've never seen look that. We </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">inherited the worst recession short of a depression and American history. I was asked to bring it back we were able to have an economic Cover either created the jobs you're talking about. We handed him a booming economy. He blew </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">it wasn't he Lewin he blooms and booming. It was it was the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">weakest recover his attorney. Is it fair to say he blew it when in fact when there was record on a low unemployment before covid? Yeah, but because what he did even before </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">covid manufacturing went in the whole </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">manufacturing went in the hole </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Excalibur once waiver to press number three, they said it would take know your number. Good to know Chris Chris. They said it would describe Miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up and Manufacturing. We did I standed fair. I'm the guy that brought back here on wood manufacturing </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">we brought back.

Vice president. And so you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done. Very little is trade deals or the same way. He talks about these great trade deals, you know, he talks about the art of the deal China is made perfected The Art of the Steal we have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest deficit trade </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">deficit with Mexico on start. - oh and no wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out billions of dollars takes out billions of dollars to manage.

That's what we're talking about is. All right, that's the end of the Sunday. We're moving. We're moving on. He didn't take them Vice President Snow </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">to be honest. It's a very important. If you had you know, what </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">your weight not true you're doing it you're going to have a true gentleman is I hate to raise my voice has to be why shouldn't I be different than the two of you? So here's the data point. We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We're going to go to the next segment in that segment you he's sure going to have to uninterrupted moments in those two interrupted minutes. Mr. President. You can say anything you want. I've been asked a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else Go ahead. But we I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you sir to do </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">that. Well and him too. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Well, frankly. You've been doing more interrupting. That's right, but he does plenty well less than 0 or less than plenty now less than you have. Let's please continue on the issue of rice Vice President Biden you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago when he talked about very fine people on both sides was what directly LED you to launch this run for president. Oh, yeah. Sure President Trump you have often said that you believe you have done more for black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years Vice President Biden you go first. It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the Constitution and we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone equality for the whole of America, but we've never accomplished it but we've never walked away from it. Like he has done it is true. The reason I got in the races when those people close your eyes remember what those people look like coming out of the fields carrying torches their veins bulging puny just spewing and I see </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Adding </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan a young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought he said they were very fine people on both sides. No </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">president has ever said anything like that finished it </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">is this is now second sir. Second </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">point I'd make to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">is that when Floyd was killed when mr. Floyd was killed there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">What did he do? He came </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">out of his bunker had the military do use tear gas on them so we could walk across. To a church </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that the bishop of that very Church said that it was the disgrace the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">general who was with him said </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">he only only everyone's through is divided people not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred racist division. This is a man who in fact you talk about helping African </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Americans one in one </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">thousand African-Americans has been killed because of Kona the coronavirus and if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year 1 in </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">500 will have been killed one in 500 African-Americans this man this man is the as a </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">savior of African-Americans. This man cares </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">that all this man's done virtually </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">nothing look the fact is that you have to look at what he's talks about. You have to look at what he did and what he did has been disastrous for the African-American </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">community. So </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">President Trump you up. Two minutes, why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">race for the crime Bill 1994 where you call them super Predators African-Americans the super predators and they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it you </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">ever said. I'm sorry. It's his two </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">minutes. So you did that and they call your super predator and I'm letting people out of jail. Now that you have treated the African-American population community. You have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country you The 1919 and that's why if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican is done in a long time because they saw what you did you call them super predators and you've called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years. You've called them a lot worse than that as far as the church is concerned. And as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200 milk 250 military leaders and Generals total support law enforcement almost every law enforcement group in the United. It states I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio I have every excuse me Portland. The sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump. I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words? So why don't you say the words law enforcement because you know, what if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour, but they won't do it because they're run by Radical left Democrats. If you look at your cargo, if you look at any place you want to look Seattle they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle Minneapolis. We got it back Joe because we believe in Law and Order but you don't the top ten cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by democrats and are many cases radical left and they've got you wrapped around their finger Joe to a point where you don't want to say anything about Law and Order and I'll tell You what the people of this country want and demand Law and Order and you're afraid to even say it. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Alright, I want to I want to return to the question of race Vice President Biden after the grand jury and the Brianna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide. You said it raises the question quote whether Justice could be equally applied in America. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country. Free yes, there is a suspect this systemic Injustice in this country in education and worked and in law enforcement and the and the way in which is enforced but look the vast majority of police officers are good decent honorable men and women, they risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">some bad apples and when </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">they occur when they find them they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">accountable. And what I'm </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">going to do is press the United States is called a Together an entire group of people at the White House, but everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers the police Chiefs and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency and when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd these kind of cops aren't happy to see what happened to Brianna Taylor most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when and </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">by the way violence in response. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Is never appropriate never appropriate peaceful protest is violence is never appropriate letters </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">peaceful protest when they run through the Mexican town and trunk burned out instructions and kill people that are promised that is a piece for you say it is </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">we're going to get to the issue of Law and Order in a moment this month your Administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training. And that addresses White Privilege or critical race Theory? Why did you decide to do that to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">sir. I ended it because it's racist I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane that it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our schools all over the place. And you know it and so does everybody else right? And he would know I don't want to talk about </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">racial sensitivity training. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">If you were a certain person you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal and if you look at the people, we would paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. And and really they were teaching people to hate our country and I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. Entry they were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It's a racist place and they would teaching people to hate our country and I'm not going to allow that to happen Vice President Biden. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Nobody's doing that. He's </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">just he's a racist you just don't here's the D. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">I know a lot more about it. Let him finish the fact is that there is racial insensitivity people have to be made aware of what other people feel like what what insults them. What is the meaning to them? It's important to people know they don't want too many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people they look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like man grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different Faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">bring everybody together. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together we can take this on and we can defeat races </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">resident. I mean President Trump's surge </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">during the obama-biden administration there was tremendous division. There was hatred you look at Ferguson you look at you. Go to very many places. Look at Oakland. Look, what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened to Frank. He was more violent than what I'm even seeing now. But the reason this is that the key Democrats that run these cities dick. You don't want to talk like you about Law and Order violent crime. Haven't mention Island. Are you in favor of Law and Order? I'm in </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">favor of law you </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">follow you a neighborhood more nautical </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">SM you have to get treated fairly and the fact of the matter is violent crime went down </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">17 percent 15 </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">percent. In our Administration has gone up on his </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">watch Downey much more he has all right, we're done here. Mr. President. Mr. President every record in the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">mr. President. You going to be very happy because we're now going to talk about </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Law and Order as we had trouble with Democratic run </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">cities. That's exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly and you often blame that on Democratic mayor's and Democratic Governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in republican-led cities like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is is this really a party issue </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">I think is a party issue you can bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago what's going on in Chicago where fifty three people were shot and ate diet shot if you look at New York where it's going up like nobody's ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a hundred hundred and fifty two hundred percent crime it is it is crazy what's going on? And he doesn't want to say Law and Order because he can't because Loses radical left supporters and once he does that it's over with but if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it we would have we were so nervous would be gone by the way. Our suburbs would be gone and you would see problems. Like if he were to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">know our suburb unless you took a wrong turn. I know celebrate would not come. I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950 all these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore suburbs are by and large integrated there. As many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and or to black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past. What's what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with covid. They're dying in the suburbs his failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in town. I do want to talk about this issue of Law and Order though and in the joint recommendation that came from the Didn't Bernie Sanders task force you talked about quote reimagining policing. First of all, what does reimagining police and mean and do you support it means let me if I might finish the question what is reimagining police and mean and do you support the black lives matter? Call for for community control of policing. Look what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm not totally opposed to defunding the police officers. It's a matter of fact police local police. The only one defending in his budget calls for a 400 million-dollar cut and local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or Kaya trust to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn't go up it went down and so we have to being that's not </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">what they're talking about is that's not what that that's exactly the funding that lie that is not true. He doesn't have any law with you poor. He has no law in force. That's not true. Most that's not really who do you have? Name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you go ahead. I </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">think we have time we don't have time to do it. No tanks. All right. All </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">right law enforcement group that came out and support them. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">And I think I'm going to I'm going to take back the bottom and I want to get to another subject which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had a more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree you talk about people. A protest many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the Democratic nominee an earlier tonight. You said that you are the Democratic party right now. Have you ever called the Democratic mayor of Portland OR the Democratic governor of Oregon and said hey, you got to stop this bring in the National Guard do whatever it takes but you'd stop the days and months of Violence in Portland. I don't hold public office now. I am a former vice president. I've made it clear. I made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who commits it but you've never called for the people. That's the latest, excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call us right in the National Guard and knock off a hundred days of riots. They can in fact take care of it if he just stay. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Of the way, okay so really here. Oh really? Here's another young man in the middle of the street and they shot him and for three days in France's president for anything and interrupted the US Marshals care </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">business. So I had sure and by the way, you know his own former spokesperson said, you know riots and chaos and violence </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">help his cause that's what this is all about a know who said that I do. Whoo, I </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">think kellyanne </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Conway. I don't she said she said that and so here's all right. Well, here's the point </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">God. Wait is that that's what he is keep </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">down instead of going in and talking to people and saying </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">let's get everybody together figure out how to deal with this. What's he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">constantly and every single solitary. Okay, and to end this button up this segment. I'm going to give you a minute to answer sir. You have repeatedly criticized answer his stuff you have Lately, you've been talking to you made a statement. I'm asking you I would love to know their I would love to invite, you know, if you want to switch seats, we could very quickly we can do that. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">But I'm saying the National Guard would be over there be no problem. Okay, but I don't want to accept the National </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Guard you have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say Say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence and a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland, are you prepared? This is epically but do it. I don't have </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">a I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right. What what are you what are you? What are you saying? I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace and do it, </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">sir. Do it say </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">do you want to call him? What do you want to call him? Give me a name. Give me my surprise that's undressing. Me, too. Stand back and stand by but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem is only as I left. I direct </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">this is a left. We got that white supremacist and teeth is an idea not an </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">organization. You've got it not malicious. That's what his tonight. If you see I his </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">FBI director said well, then, you know what we're done sir. We're moving on to the next </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">one. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">The truth is a bad idea. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">I tell you what. I've no idea to and Tifa is a dangerous </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">radical man. We're now moving on to the trumpet like the records will overthrow you in a president. I'm going to ask a question when the president seeks a second term. It is generally a referendum on his record. But Vice President Biden you like to quote one of your dad's sayings which is don't compare me to the almighty compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir, you are the It is looking at both of your records. I'm going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment President Trump you go first two minutes </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">because there is never been an administration of president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years and that's despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where was a whole big con job, but despite going through all of these. Things were had a fight both flanks and behind me in and above there has never been an Administration. That's done. What I've done the greatest before covid came in the greatest economy in history. Lowest employment unemployment numbers. Everything was good everything was going and by the way, there was Unity going to happen people were calling me for the first time in years. They were calling and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? We got hit but now we're building it back up again, rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other. Is a fixing of the VA which was a mess under him three hundred eight thousand people died because they didn't have proper Health Care. He was a mess and we now got a 91 percent approval rating at the VA our vets. We take care of our vets but we've rebuilt our military the job that we've done and I'll tell you some some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I'll have approximately 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges. Hopefully three great Supreme Court judges justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and you know, one of the reasons I have so many judges because President Obama and him left me a hundred and twenty eight judges to fill when you leave office. You don't leave any judges that's like you just don't do that. They left a hundred and twenty eight openings. And if I were a member of his party because they have a little different philosophy. I'd say if you left Us a hundred and twenty eight openings. You can't be a good president. You can't be a good vice president, but I want to thank you because it gives us almost it'll probably be above that number by the end of this term. I'm sorry 300 judges. It's a record </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">looking at both here records. Why should voters elect you president as opposed to president from you up two minutes uninterrupted under this President. We become weaker sicker poor more divided and more. When I was vice president We inherited a recession I was asked to fix it. I did we left him a booming economy and he caused the recession with regard to being weaker. The </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">fact is that I've gone head-to-head with Putin and made it </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">clear to him. We're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin's puppy. He </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers your son got him. And </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">by the way, Mr. President your campaign agreed to both sides would get two-minute answers uninterrupted. Well your side agreed to it and why Don't You observe with your campaign agreed to as a ground rule? Okay, sir. You never keeps his word kinetics don't know I'm not out of that was a rhetorical question can go ahead act 30 seconds. Yes, you may have. All right, go ahead. So thirdly we're poor the billionaires have gotten much much more Wealthy </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">by tune of over four three two. 400 billion </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">dollars more just since covid </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">you and the home you got less you're in more trouble than you were before </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">in terms of being more violent when we were in office of our </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">15% less violence in America than there is today. He's president and States. It's on his watch </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">and with regard to more divided the nation can't </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">stay divided. We can't be this way </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">and speaking of my son the way you talk about </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">the military the way you talk about them. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Losers and being and and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">spent a year there. He got he got the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Bronze Star he got the conspicuous </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">service medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot and the people left behind there. We're heroes really and I resent you talking like hell you took my son Beau Biden you're tight on about I don't know Bo I know honey Throne Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was Thrown out dishonorably discharged that's not true. Is it to talk can use and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. What do you not have that present? He made a fortune in Ukraine in China. And Masa is simply areas of the pleasures. He my son what you enjoyed my son and he didn't have a GI </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">son. Like a lot of people like a lot of people, you know at home had a drug problem. He's overtaking it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it and I'm </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">proud of them, but why was out of my son? Wasn't giving tens of Millions on that is a totally different totally </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">horny big party, but totally discredited we both we've already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial to subjects. Well, you know as the moderator sir, I'm going to make a judgment </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">call here three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow report is </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">totally discredited Romney on that committee said it </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">wasn't worth taxpayers money that report is written for </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">political reasons. No, I'd like to talk about climate change or would I okay? The forest fires in the west are raging now, they have burned millions of Acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people when State officials there blame the fires on climate change. Mr. President. You said I don't think the science knows over your four years. You have pulled the u.s. Out of the Paris climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama and Vine medical records. What do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">it? I want Crystal Clean Water and Air. I want beautiful clean air we have now the lowest carbon if you look at our numbers right now we are doing phenomenally, but I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint and people are actually very happy. Happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned. You need Forest Management. In addition to everything else. The forest floors are loaded up with trees dead trees that are years old and they're like Tinder and leaves and everything else you drop a cigarette in there the whole Forest Burns and you've got to have Forest manage. What are you going to behave? What do you </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">believe about the science of climate change sir? </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">I believe that we have to do everything we can to have Immaculate are Immaculate water and do whatever. Else we can that's good. You know, we're planting a billion trees the billion Tree project and it's very explicitly that that </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">human pollution gasps greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of possessing </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">a lot of things do but I think to an extent. Yes, I think to an extent. Yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest every year I get the call California's burning California's burning if that was cleaned if that were if you had Forest management good Good Forest management. You wouldn't be getting those calls, you know in Europe. They live their Forest cities. They call Forest cities. They maintain their for us. They manage their for us. I was with the head of a major country. It's a Forest City. He said sir. We have trees that are far more. They ignite much easier than California. They shouldn't be that problem. I spoke with the governor about I'm getting along very well with the governor, but I said, you know at some point you can't every year have hundreds of Instead of acres of land just burn to the ground. So that's burning down because of a lack </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">of a matter if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama clean power plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">as he was driving Energy prices through the </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">sky have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars that </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">probably because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. Our and you're talking about a tiny difference and then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchase. We have the old slugs out there that attend 12 years old. If you did that the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500 for Nia. They've simply helped or hurt your ankle a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car now. So and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me many people the car has gotten so expensive. Answer because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit okay of gasoline. And and and I'm okay with electric cars to I think I'm all for electric because I've given big incentives for electric cars. But what they've done in California is just </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">crazy Vice President Biden. I'd like you to respond to the Presidents climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern you propose to trillion dollars in green jobs. You talk about new limits not abolishing but new limits on. Fracking ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The President says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs. He's absolutely wrong. Number one. Number two. If in fact went on during our Administration The Recovery Act I was able to I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">as coal and </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">gas and oil. Nobody's going to build </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">another </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">coal-fired plant in America. No one's going to build another </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">oil-fired plant in America. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">They're going to move to renewable energy number 1 </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">number 2. We're going to </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">make sure that we are able to take the federal Fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles making sure that we can do that. We're going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for For the ability us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to NetZero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs creating jobs </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">creating millions of good-paying. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Jobs, not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage by having a new infrastructure. That in fact is green. And the first thing I will do I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">because with us out of it, look what's </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">happening. It's all falling apart and talk about someone who has no no relationship to do with foreign policy Brazil. The rainforest to Brazil are being torn down are being ripped down more more carbon is absorbed in that. Rainforest and every bit of carbon that's admitted in the United States instead of doing something about that. I would be gathering up and making sure we had to come to the countries of the world coming up with twenty billion dollars a here's twenty billion dollars. Stop. Stop tearing down the forest and if you don't then you're going to have significant Economic Consequences of what about the argument that the President Trump basically says that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests and Drawn his line. He had drawn a line. He still could for example make sure that we he wants to make sure </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">that methane is not a problem. We can </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">you can now admit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Now, this is </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">the guy who says that the fact that it's all true. And here's the </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">deal about the green New Deal and it's not two billion over 20 billion. As you said, it's 100 trillion dollars. I'm I'm talking about they want to write down building but now and rebuild the building its the down the street that is not where airplanes are adamant as as I said we're to car systems are out where they want to take out the cows taught. You know, that's not true either right now. This is a this is a 100 trillion. That's more money than our country could make in a hundred players if we're gone </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">and it includes Grating 4 million buildings, whether Rising 2 million homes over four years building one and a half million energy-efficient homes. So the question becomes some the president is saying I think some people who support the president would say that sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">What it could do is going to create thousands and millions of jobs good paying job, but let them finish sir. He doesn't know how to do that. They in Dallas. The </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">fact is it's going to create millions of good-paying job. Jobs, and these tax incentives to people for people to weatherize which he wants to get get rid of it's going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes with deal with by the way. He has an answer for hurricanes. He said maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them. They </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">may I never said that I should he did say made it up. And here's the deal you make up and we are going to be in a </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">position where we can create hard hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean. We all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now billions of dollars on floods hurricanes Rising Seas. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">We're in real trouble. Look what's happened to just in the midwest with these </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">storms that come through and wipe out </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before there because of global warming we make up 15% of </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">the world's problem. We in fact but the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into go back into the Paris Accord. All right gentlemen, </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">will you Chris? So why didn't he do it for 47 years, you would vice president. Why didn't you get the world China sends up real dirt into the air Russia does India does they all do we're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. Not not my plan. That's three. Well, who won? The military he and his friends made it up and then they went with it. I never said okay, that is what </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">he called a pilot area vice </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">president best. I decided I would never say that </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">playoffs. Play it go ahead. Mr. Vice president answered his his final question. The final question is I can't remember which of all is Randy's having a little trouble myself, but and about The economy and about this question of what it's going to cost the economy. The equipment were in New Deal and the idea of what what your environmental change healed the green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We're not going to build plants that in fact our great polluting plan to use to build a new deal. Pardon me you support no, I don't support the </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">green New Deal don't oh, well, that's a big statement except for the radical left. I said, I support the Biden plan that I </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">put forward. Okay, the Biden plan which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. All right, gentlemen, final segment election Integrity as we meet tonight millions of Americans are receiving mail in ballots or going to vote early how confident should we be that this will be a fair election. And what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots. It's mail in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election in this final segment. Mr. Vice president you go. First prepared to let people vote Miss you go to I will vote.com decide how they're going to vote when they're going to vote. And what means by which they're going to vote his own Homeland Security director as well as the FBI director says there is no evidence at all that mail in ballots are a source of Manipulated and cheating. They said that the fact is that they're going to be millions of people because of covid that are going to be voting by mail in ballots like he does by the way. He sits behind the Resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida. Number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because they're not poll Watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted and this is all about trying to dissuade Wade people from voting because he's trying to confuse to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">legitimate show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election vote vote vote. If you're able to vote early in your state vote early if you're able to vote in person mode in person, but whatever way is the best way for you because you will he cannot stop you </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">from being able to determine the outcome of this election and in terms of whether or not when the votes are counted and they're all Counting. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">That will be accepted if I win that will be accepted if I lose I'll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says he's not sure what he's going to accept. Well, let me tell you some it doesn't matter because if we get the votes it's going to be all over he's going to go he can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand you have it </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to changing it for? More years of these lies, mr. President two minutes. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I want I won that election and if you look at Crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign they started from the day. I want an even before I won from the day. I came down the escalator with a first lady they We're a disaster. They were disgrace to our country and we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all and by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense and President Obama was sitting in the office he knew about it too. So don't tell me about it free transition as far as the ballots are concerned. It's a disaster a solicited ballot. Okay solicit it is. Okay you soliciting your asking they send it back you. Send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud they found him in Creeks. They found some with the name Trump just happen to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent to and a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen the other thing. It's nice on November 3rd, you're watching and you see who won the election and I think we're going Do well because people are really happy with the job we've done but you know what we won't know we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over take a look at what happened in Manhattan take a look at what happened in New Jersey take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2% 1% which by the way is too much an election could be won or lost with it. They'll loosen 30 and 40% It's a fraud and it's a shame and can you imagine where they say you have to have your ballot in by November? 10th November 10th, that means that's seven days after the election in theory should have been announced. Okay, we have major states with that sorrow run by democrats has two minutes all run, right you're Democrats. It says an impromptu rigged </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">election. You're going to be able to continue you have been charging for months and mail and balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's rigged I said, it's going to lead to fraud but in 2018 in the last midterm election 31 million people voted. Ln voting that was a quarter more than a quarter of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mahlon ballots have gone out. What are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court including a Justice Barrett to settle any </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">dispute? I think I'm counting in them to look at the balance. Definitely. I don't think well, I hope we don't need them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots, I think so because what's happening? Is incredible I just heard I read today. We're at least one percent of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They they take them we don't like them. We don't like him but it wrong </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">out of there are millions of ballots going out. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">What you do is you go and vote you do a solicited ballot. No. No, that's okay. Now where you going I'm </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">asking you about the fact that millions of </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">people you go and Road you go and vote but like digging us like they used to in the old millions of people need to do Chris a solicited ballot where you're sending it into sending it back in your sin. They have maehlman with lots of it. Did you see what's going on take a look at West Virginia? Maehlman selling the ballots. They're being sold there being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country as mrs. Not as no this is not going to end. Well, they're all kind of ways is not going to present in five states </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">and ballots for the last decade or more five, including two Republican states, and you don't have to solicit the ballot it sent to you it sent to your home. What we're saying is they're saying is that has to be a postmarked by the time by election day. If the doesn't get in till the seventh eighth ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">be wrong. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">You're all that. I want to continue with you on this loved Vice President Biden </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">because she's so rude when he makes a statement. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">Excuse me, Vice President Biden the biggest problem. In fact over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud historically. It has been that Sizable number sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots were thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity or they Misty through the deadline. So the question I have is are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute. I'm concerned that any Court would settle this because here's the deal when you when you file when you get a ballot and you </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">fill it out you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know you have someone say that this Me you should be able to if in </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">fact you can verify that you when the before the ballot is thrown </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">out that sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">dotting the correct died </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">who they voted for testify say who they voted for </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">say, it's you that is totally legitimate. All right excited that don't you? States from even beginning to process ballots even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it's likely because there's going to be a huge increase in mail and validating that we are not going to know on Election night who the winner is that it could be days it could Be weeks would be months until we find out who the the new president is. So I first for you sir, finally for the for the vice president. I hope neither of you will interrupt the other will your urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period not to engage in any civil unrest and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified President Trump you go first thing my </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">supporters to go into the poles and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know today there was a big problem in Philadelphia. They went in to watch they were called poll Watchers a very safe very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know, why because bad things happen in Philadelphia bad things and I am urging I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election if it's a fair election what I am a hundred percent on board, but if I see tens of A balance being manipulated. I can't go along with that and I'll tell what do I decide from a </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">common-sense? Does that mean you're going to want to be able to take to the media of a </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">fraudulent election? You send me out of 80 million ballots are not equipped to these people aren't equipped to handle it. Number one. Number two, they cheat they cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago and they all had the name military balance there were military. They all had the name Trump on </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">them vice president. That's good. Vice president. Byron final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified. Yes. And here's the deal the account the balance as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day and if there's thousands of ballots going to take time to do it and by the way our military, they've been voting by balance for sensitive the end of the Civil War in effect in effect. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">And that's and that's what's happened going to happen. Why was it not why is it for </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">them? Somehow not fraudulent. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">that there is fraud related to mail in ballots that the somehow it's a fraudulent </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">process already been established take a look at my auntie's race. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">You had an opportunity. They have no idea why go ahead. He has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal the fact is I I will accept it and he will too. You know, why because once the winner is declared after all the all the ballots are counted. All the votes are counted. </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">That'll be the end of it. That would be the end of it. And if </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">it's me in fact fine, if it's not me, I'll support the outcome and I'll be a president not just for the Democrats. I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">this guy I wanted to thank God </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">lemon we say that's the end of it. This is the end of this debate </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">spell it count. We're going to leave it there. </span><span style="background-color:#f0429e">To to be continued as in more debates as we go on President Trump Vice President. Biden has been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event the next debate sponsored by the commission on presidential debates will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees vice president Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9 p.m. Eastern that night. We hope you watch until then. Thank you and good night. </span><span style="background-color:#44dc4d">And that concludes PBS's coverage of this first presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle. Welcome back to the PBS newshour's special coverage. I'm Judy Woodruff at our studio in Washington DC. I have to say I've never seen a debate like this one. It was more of a brawl at times than it was a debate. The president repeatedly was asked by Moderator Chris Wallace not to interrupt there were tough words exchanged the president accused Joe Biden of being radical left of being not smart. Someone who's trying to steal the election. We heard Joe Biden say, he's the worst president the country's ever had and at one point early in the debate said shut up man. I think it's fair to say we broke new ground with presidential debates joining me now, too. Look at a little of what was said tonight the newshour's you Michel sender and Lisa Desjardins. Let's turn to you you meesh first. The president was determined to have his say tonight, wasn't he? That's right Judy. This was an all-out dogfight a brawl. It was fierce. It was personal. The president said that Joe Biden could not have handled the coronavirus pandemic. He said that he wasn't smart. He also went after him and accused him of being a socialist and then he was on the defense with as Joe Biden called him a clown a racist a liar saying he was the worst president in the United States President Trump also in and it's a moment to remember he was asked several times. Will you denounce white supremacist? He said quote Out Boys stand back and stand by also want to do a quick fact check Judy because that was a remarkable moment, but there was another remarkable moment and it was when Chris Wallace pose the question multiple times to President Trump how much taxes have you paid? We should pull up that graphic now on President Trump's taxes. He paid according to the New York Times 750 dollars in federal income taxes in 2016 and 750 in 2017. He did not pay income taxes 10 out of the 15 years beginning in 2000 due to losses president. Um pushed back on that report. He said he's paid millions of taxes. He said some years. He's paid as much as thirty eight million, but just like in 2016. He said he can't release his tax returns because he because he is under audit Joe Biden release his tax returns along with Kamala Harris today. So Joe Biden said, it's time to release her taxes. The president wouldn't do that and we heard Joe Biden and the moderator say, when are we going to see your taxes? And the president did not answer as he has not previously Lisa in terms of Joe Biden. He was as we said interrupted a lot, but he gave as good as he got at points. He did first. I almost feel like I have to take a deep breath and just say I hope everybody out there is okay that was quite an experience. We had there's a lot to unpack and we talked about Joe Biden one thing when argument he made was he said that violent crime went down under his and President Obama's administration more than with President Trump. Let's look at a graphic about what we know about that Biden quoted a statistic. He said it went down 17 to 15% That's true. The FBI crime statistics show that the violent crime. Rate, so the rate per capita did go down sixteen percent under President Barack Obama. Now Biden also said that murder rates have gone up. And in fact, he said everything has gone up in terms of violent crime under President Trump that we do not yet know, in fact the FBI statistics show that the rate of violent crime dipped in 2017 and 2018 under President Trump. We do not yet have statistics Judy for 2019. There is some data that shows especially specially in cities some murder rates have gone up and violent crime has gone up in the last year, but the FBI has not compiled those statistics yet. So it's really extrapolating what some people see in general and it's not yet known just quickly to the to you and your Miche in terms of covid. The president's handling of covid. We heard a lot of criticism from Joe Biden about the number of Americans who died you meesh is the president saying anything. What did you here tonight? Trashed it with what the president has said on covid. The president really was saying what he's always said on covid-19. He did the best that he could do. We talked about the fact that he banned travel from China what he did of course would not ban complete travel from China. There were Americans that were coming in from China Europeans that were coming in from China at one point. So the president was saying that he really is trying to make sure also that this vaccine is getting going to be out and in the hands of Americans as soon as possible Health officials say his timeline seem to be quicker than they can imagine. The other thing to note is that the president really talked about the fact that the It is doing a good job in the coronavirus. I don't think we have the graphic up right now. But what I will say is that the United States is doing poorly when you look at modernize industrialized nations, when you compare it to Germany the European Union other countries, you see that our desk and our infections are higher than those other countries that we compare ourselves to so the president was not right in trying to say that the United States is handling the coronavirus well and and Lisa just quickly Joe Biden was challenged by the president to explain why he wasn't in favor of closing down China earlier and it some at one point it got into a discussion about who believes the scientists and and what Biden had said about that. That's right. And also the words of his running mate, Kamala Harris came into play her words that she was fearful that scientists could be muzzled Chris Wallace question, whether that raised more fear that if was contributing to the problem Biden's answer to that was no it was sort of pointing out from his point of view and issue with the Trump Administration and how they handle science in their view repressing the science. All right, Lisa Desjardins. Yeah, Michel sender turning now to some analysis of the debate. We're joined by our panel Amy Walter of the cook political report host of public radio's politics with Amy Walter Gary Abernathy contributing columnist for the Washington Post. He joins us from Cincinnati and Cynthia Tucker. She's a syndicated columnist and journalist in Residence at the University of South Alabama. So Amy Walter, I don't know if you've seen a debate like this one. I certainly haven't but give us your take away. Yeah, it's I'm still trying to recover from what we saw here Judy and I don't know that anybody should feel particularly good about what just happened for the last 90 minutes or if anybody will really remember anything about the last 90 minutes other than it looked like a food fight. And in fact, I'm quite curious if we had dial test to see how many people after the first 15 minutes actually turn this thing off. But look as I said at the very beginning the goal if you're Donald Trump is to change the Narrative in this race to put Joe Biden on the defensive to make the focus a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden instead of just a referendum on Donald Trump. And I don't think he was particularly effective in doing that tonight. Now what he was able to do by the constant interrupting was to kind of get Joe Biden out of a Groove Joe Biden never was able to get into a comfortable smooth place to make his case, but he didn't rattle him. I think in the way that at Trump and Trump advisors had hoped where he would either say something completely terrible or meltdown or lose his looted lose his train of thought but you know, this goes back to the challenge. The President Trump has had from the very beginning the way he operates is the way he likes to operate and there is a certain percent of the American public that Also likes to see that his problem is there are more people who don't like that behavior and part of the reason that the president is trailing right now. Is that independent voters women Suburban voters what they tell us over and over again is this exact kind of style The Bullying that interrupting the chaos is what they're exhausted by and so what the president was offering was four more years of that which to his supporters might be appealing but to the folks out there who've already decided they don't want any more of that. He didn't offer any other option and Gary Abernathy. I believe you told us going into this debate that you thought the greater burden was on Joe Biden to show that he could be a president the right presents the right alternative. What did you see? </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">Yeah, I think the challenge for Biden was really to answer Trump's Challenge and his questioning about whether he could do a 90 minute debate had the stamina for it the focus for it and he did that. I thought he was shaky at times. But but he did that and given that you know, that's kind of a low bar. But the fact that Biden is leading in the polls right now. That was probably good for him. I think when the dust settled tonight, I don't think anything changes. Which is good for biting if you're in the lead, I thought that Biden was a little weak tonight on the Law and Order issues and I thought he was a little weak on he won't answer whether he would pack the court or not Judy and I think at some point he really have to ants answer that question. I thought that Trump went too far on some of his attacks on Hunter Biden in particular. There's some legitimate questions there, but Trump made it to personal in a way that I think could could lead to actually some some empathy for Biden because Trump was just so aggressive. So, you know four years ago Trump did well by kind of presenting himself as not the politician that appeal to a lot of people. I'm not the politician. I'm not the professional after tonight. We'll see whether some people particularly swing voters begin to think to themselves, you know, maybe a professional politician is not such a bad idea. </span><span style="background-color:#44dc4d">Cynthia Tucker, what did you make of what we watched </span><span style="background-color:#a8bd5d">my goodness Judy? This is the first World Wrestling Federation match. I think I've ever seen I assign my students to write about this debate and one of the questions I asked him was what did they learn? I can't wait to see what their answers were. I'm not sure anything any viewer learned anything much tonight, but I have to agree. The analysis that President Trump needed to move the needle he's behind in the polls and I can't imagine that he did that. I am sure that his base people who like his style his pugilistic style his always attacking his personal attacks certainly think he carried the day but as Amy said earlier for all of those those voters who are exhausted by the sense of chaos that has already engulfed their lives what they saw from President Trump. I think promise just four more years of that. I will be interested to see what the next debate is. Like whether the moderators think that they can come up with a method of having the speakers stick to the rules more often, but I'm not sure that they can ask for Biden. I think that Trump and his allies had already set the bar so low for him what he needed to do. He accomplished he didn't commit. Any gas that will dominate The Net new cycle over the next 24 hours. I thought he made some very good points on covid on health care and on racism. I thought he did well on those he but it was also in many ways from both candidates one of the meanest most demoralizing debates I've ever seen for Ins sakes Not only was the president yelling and calling Biden a liar. But Biden called the president of the United States a clown and said he was the worst president in American history again, I'd never seen anything like it and I could go for the rest of my life not seeing another debate like </span><span style="background-color:#44dc4d">I think a lot of people will be wondering if the next two presidential debates will match this one in terms of the temperature and the language but we will see Cynthia Tucker Gary Abernathy Amy Walter. We thank all three of you for sitting through this with us. And now I want to turn to our senior National correspondent Tom Neva. She's been watching the debate along with a group of Americans as part of our voices of the voters project. their reactions Judy we began the night with six voters three leaning towards voting for. Mr. Biden 3 leaning towards voting for President Trump and we ended basically in exactly the same way. I can tell you even though a lot of them had different ideas about some of the issues some of the approaches as we checked in with them and had a conversation as they watch the debate and we all watched it together. We kind of ended the evening with bipartisan support on a few big issues one. None of them found the debate informative. None of them thought there was nearly enough policy. Nearly, everyone said that they were disappointed by both candidates conduct during the debate a couple of quick pull outs. Austin is one of our voters we were focusing on because he's a college student. He comes from a family of Republicans, but he's leaning towards voting for President Biden. He basically said he doesn't think either the did particularly well, so he's not changing his mind Lorraine is a principal from California. She compared the candidates Behavior to kindergarteners on the playground Bruce who's a retired police officer also said he was disappointed. Appointed and he felt that both candidates took it too personal in some of their attacks disappointment across the board from these voters and no one has moved from their position that they began with 90 minutes ago Judy. So just quickly on they didn't they didn't hold one candidate or another more responsible except except coming from the sides. They already supported. No, that's right Judy. I think most of them went into the night wanting to feel better about their candidate looking as they said for a little bit more policy for a little bit more polish. All of them say that they walked away disappointed by all by both of the candidates conduct over the course of the evening and they also said Judy the first question I ask them coming out at the end of the debate. Does anyone feel like they learned anything new. Do you feel like you learn anything new about your candidate about a policy about an issue not a single person raised their Yet they're all going to be watching the next debate as well and Judy we're going to continue the conversation as well. We'll talk to them for another 25 30 minutes and get their full takeaways all their reactions on the issues that's going to take place online at pbs.org NewsHour. And I hope folks join us there to tune into that conversation Jude and I know people will want to do that on was going to continue her conversation with these voters talk to them about what their Impressions were in detail and will continue to report on that online. Line and of course on the NewsHour tomorrow night. So at the end of this this remarkable evening, I think raising questions about the nature of the next two presidential debates in the cycle. Both of them will take place in the month of October along with a vice presidential debate, which we're guessing will will come across with a slightly different tenor than this one maybe a dramatically different tenor, but we'll find out but that does conclude the news our special coverage of this. 20/20 presidential debate.
